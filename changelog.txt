/*
    Version 1.1.0 update - Ryan K:
        - Add support for DEL or BACKSPACE characters (support for multiple terminals that send different character for backspace)
        - Fixed bug where backspace was printed even if the pointer was at the beggining of the command buffer
        - Add support for blank command entry (user spams "enter" like we all do on a linux terminal)
        - Add pointer to Stream (allows user to pass different Serial streams for HW with multiple serial interfaces)
            - Supports HardwareSerial or SoftwareSerial to be passed
        - Re-arrange constructor / begin statements (begin is not mandatory any longer, and is only used to set Stream speed if not previously initialized)
        - Add support for a polling 'exit character' to allow calling loops to end the command line interface, if desired
