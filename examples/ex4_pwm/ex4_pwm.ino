where you can define your own commands and pass arguments
to them.

  cmd.begin(57600);
  
  // add the commands to the command table. These functions must
  // already exist in the sketch. See the functions below. 
  // The functions need to have the format:
  //
  // void func_name(int arg_cnt, char **args)
  //
  // arg_cnt is the number of arguments typed into the command line
  // args is a list of argument strings that were typed into the command line

// This is another example to demonstrate how command line arguments can
// be used when calling your sketch function from the command line. 
//
// This function sets the brightness of an LED on pin 10 via PWM from the 
// command line. If no args are present,then the LED will be turned off.
// 
// Usage: At the command line, to set the brightness, type: 
// pwm 100
//
// This will set the LED brightness to a level of 100 (on a range of 0-255) 
//
// Usage: At the command line, to turn off the LED, type:
// pwm
//
// This will turn off the LED.
// 
// Similar to ex3, when you use numeric arguments, you'll need to use the
// cmdStr2Num function to convert the numeric string into a usable integer.
// See ex3 or the tutorial for more information on this function.
